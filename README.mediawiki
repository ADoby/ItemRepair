v1.83.7

==Credits==
A lot of credit goes to lostaris; I heavily adapted his original plugin to make this compatible with Vault, support the latest versions, etc.
==At a glace==
*Repairs your tools, weapons and armour
*Repairs can either be free, cost items, cost via economy, or both; these can vary on a per-item basis.
*Repairs can be triggered manually or automatically
*Allows for indestructible tools
*Works on enchanted items too!
*Permissions support through PermissionsBukkit (may work, but not tested with, other Permissions systems)
*Economy support through Vault
*Repairs can be set to have varying cost depending on how damaged the item is

==Features==
Allows a player can repair their tools, either manually or automatically just before they break. Automatic repairing will trigger on hitting a block with a tool when the tool is about to break. This repairing can be done at the cost of a given amount of one or more materials, a set amount of money if an economy system is in use, or for free.

===New===
* Added new config option for "economy" property: keyword 'config' allows per-item cost "type" variance (i.e. economy, item, both), as dictated by the cost listed for each item in the AutoRepair.properties file. See the sections on AutoRepair.properties and Config.properties for more info.
* Added "allow enchanted item repair" config option and permission node. See Config.properties for more info.

==Setup==
===AutoRepair.properties===
The AutoRepair.properties file sits in your plugin/AutoRepair folder. This file dictates the items that can be repaired, and the (changeable) values associated with repairing that item. The format is as follows (items in <> are optional, with one catch, listed below under '''the catch'''):


<nowiki>[item to be repaired]:[said item's durability]:<[hex val of item to repair with],[amount of that item to use]:[next item to repair with],[amount of next item to use] econ=[cost of repairing when using economy]></nowiki>

A real use case is:

<blockquote>GOLD_SPADE=33:13,1:280,2 econ=25</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEARS=287:65,2</blockquote>

Translation: Gold Spades can be used 33 times before dying; it costs 25 [currency] and/or 1 gravel and 2 sticks to repair. Shears can be used 287 times before dying; they cost 2 ladders to repair.

'''The catch''': Your AutoRepair.properties file must match the "economy" property in your Config.properties file, or things aren't going to work correctly. For example, if you have the config set up to use economy costs, you '''must''' have economy costs in the repair recipes file. If you set the config to use both, you must have both. Additionally, if you set the "economy" property to 'config', you set the cost type of each individual item by varying what costs you list in the recipes file, but you '''must''' have at least ONE cost type listed for each item. 

===Config.properties===
Config.properties is also located in the plugin/AutoRepair folder. It contains several settable parameters:
*'''auto-repair''' controls if the auto repairing is turned on ''[true]'', off ''[false]'', or off with no warnings ''[false-nowarnings]''
*'''repair-costs''' controls whether repairs have a cost ''[true]'' or not ''[false]''; ''[false-nomessages]'' turns off repair costs and "item repaired" notifications. 
*'''permissions''' controls if the plugin will use ''[true]'' or will not use ''[false]'' the permissions plugin
*'''economy''' controls if the plugin will use iConomy cash ''[true]'', iConomy cash and items ''[both]'', just items ''[false]'', or have each item's cost type dictated by the AutoRepair.properties file ''[config]''
*'''item_rounding''' controls if item damage affects item cost ''[round]'', damage affects cost but still a minimum cost of 1 of each item ''[min]'', or damage doesn't affect cost ''[flat]''
*'''econ_fractioning''' does the same thing as item rounding, but for economy costs, if they're used, and can only be ''[on]'' or ''[off]''
*'''[NEW] allow_enchanted''' controls if repairing enchanted items is always allowed ''[true]'', never allowed ''[false]'', or ''[permissions]'' based, tied to the AutoRepair.repair.enchanted node.

==Economy==
Usage of an economy plugin via Vault is optional. You can configure this plugin to use an economy plugin's cash to charge for a repair. However, if you wish to use an economy plugin you MUST also run Vault.

==Permissions==
Bukkit permissions is optional and if permissions is either not installed or is disabled for this plugin all features will be available for all users. Will be turned on if the line permissions=false in the config.properties file is changed to true.

Available permission nodes are (case sensitive):
*AutoRepair.access - allows the use of this plugin, without this a user cannot do anything
*AutoRepair.info -- allows the use of the ? and dmg commands
*AutoRepair.warn - allows warning when a tool is about to break
*AutoRepair.repair -- allows items in a user's inventory to be repaired, whether automatic or manually
*AutoRepair.repair.enchanted - allows enchanted items to be repaired, if autorepair config is set accordingly
*AutoRepair.auto -- enables AutoRepair of tools in a user's inventory
*AutoRepair.reload -- allows a user to reload the plugin


==Commands Usage==
*'/rep [quickbar slot 1-9]' repairs the tool/armour in this slot and deducts cost from inventory
*'/rep [quickbar slot 1-9] ?' tells you what item and how much of it is needed to repair this item
*'/rep [quickbar slot 1-9] dmg' tells you how many uses are left before this tool breaks or '/rep', '/rep ?', '/rep dmg' for the item in your hand
*'/rep all' to repair ALL repairable items in your inventory including worn armour
*'/rep arm' repairs all of your currently equipped armour
*'/rep arm ?' tells you what you need to repair your equipped armour
*'/rep reload' reloads the config files
